 Data Science Project for Learning. 
 Using python languange and written in python notebook.
 
## [Building Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch](https://github.com/agusrichard/data-science-learning-projects/tree/master/Scratch%20Implementation)

To better understand machine learning, we have to know what kind of process happens under the hood of machine learning algorithms. In here, I try to implement the algorithm myself, to better understand the method some machine learning algorithms use and get some coding experience.

Contents: 
- train_test_split implementation


## [Data Science Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/agusrichard/data-science-learning-projects/tree/master/Cheat%20Sheet)

This cheat sheet is made by composing several learning notes from different data science and machine learning books. The purposes are for notes and refreshers when forgetting something.
