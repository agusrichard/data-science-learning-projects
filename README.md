 Data Science Project for Learning and Portfolio. 
 Using python languange and written in python notebook.
 

## [20 News Groups](https://github.com/agusrichard/data-science-projects/tree/master/News%20Groups)

In this project, I perform predictive modeling using a bunch of machine learning algorithms, which starts with data cleaning and preliminary step. The accuracy score for this project is 81%, without using NLP preprocessing step. So it still can be improved.

## [Nobel Prize Winners](https://github.com/agusrichard/data-science-projects/tree/master/Nobel%20Prize%20Winners)

This project is an exploratory data analysis. In here, I ask several questions that can be answered by looking and analyzing the data. Such as, which country contributes the most for Nobel Laureates, and what is the shape of Nobel Laureates' age distribution, and many more.
